To get started,

1. Click the "[Download ZIP](http://bit.ly/GAIntroToCode)" button and save the `.zip` file onto your computer (the desktop is a great place for a project like this).
2. Once saved, unzip the archived folder (double-clicking (Mac), or following [these instructions](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/compress-uncompress-files-zip-files) for Windows users).
